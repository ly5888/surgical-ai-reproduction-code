## Prerequisite
### Dataset
![](https://github.com/liamheng/CAI-algorithms/blob/main/figs/dataset_overview_github.png)

**The annotated CatInstSeg and CatS can be found at:**

- [CatInstSeg](https://github.com/liamheng/CAI-algorithms/blob/main/storage/datasets/CatInstSeg)
- [CatS](https://github.com/liamheng/CAI-algorithms/blob/main/storage/datasets/CatS)

**Dataset Preprocessing:** [Category Standardization](https://github.com/liamheng/CAI-algorithms/blob/main/Category%20Standardization.pdf)

**Note:** A "mapping_merge_tools.csv" file is necessary for your dataset. For example, if your CaDIS dataset is located in "storage/datasets/cadis", then there should be a "mapping_merge_tools.csv" in the same directory. We provide an example file for label mapping in CaDIS dataset. [Example](https://github.com/liamheng/CAI-algorithms/blob/main/static/mapping_merge_tools.csv)


### Package dependency

- easydict==5.1.1
- imageio==2.34.2
- matplotlib==3.8.4
- numpy==1.26.4
- pillow==10.4.0
- pytorch==2.3.1
- torchvision==0.18.1
- tqdm==4.66.4
- yaml==0.2.5

## Source Pretraining

**We provide the checkpoints of pretrain model for convenience:**

[Deeplabv3_ResNet50](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/c4gd9jw8tq471o5jxu95l/deeplabv3_cadis.pth?rlkey=pqotfmc5cpb7crklbawvz0dl3&st=xgoxvc61&dl=0)


For source pretraining phase of MUTA model, run the following command:

```sh
# source_muta
bash storage/scripts/muta_source_cadis.sh # training on dataset CaDIS
```
**Updated:** We now provide the pretrained weights of muta_source in [storage folder](https://github.com/liamheng/CAI-algorithms/blob/main/storage/checkpoints/source_domain)

Alternatively, we provide a pretrained deeplabv3 [storage folder](https://github.com/liamheng/CAI-algorithms/blob/main/storage/checkpoints/deeplabv3_cadis):
```sh
# source_deeplabv3
bash storage/scripts/deeplabv3_cadis.sh # testing script of deeplabv3
```
## Adaptation
As mentioned in paper, we provide solutions for both domain adaptation scenarios without source.

To conduct **Test Time Adaptation(TTA)**, where each sample is adapted individually, run the following command:

```sh
# tta_muta
bash storage/scripts/muta_tta_cadis2catinstseg.sh # tta from CaDIS to CatInstSeg
```
For **Source Free Domain Adaptation(SFDA)**, where samples from target domain are adapted all together, run the command:

```sh
# sfda_muta
bash storage/scripts/muta_sfda_cadis2catinstseg.sh # sfda from CaDIS to CatInstSeg
```

Similar to the source pretraining procudure, we provide the deeplabv3 versions for TTA and SFDA respectively:

```sh
# tta_deeplabv3
bash storage/scripts/deeplanv3_tta_cadis2catinstseg.sh # tta from CaDIS to CatInstSeg

# sfda_deeplabv3
bash storage/scripts/deeplanv3_sfda_cadis2catinstseg.sh # sfda from CaDIS to CatInstSeg
```

For experiments on CatS dataset, simply replace the 'data_root' in the script. Besides, be careful to check the correctness of the label mapping file.
